# Dynamic Portfolio

## Overview

I created a dynamic and responsive portfolio to showcase my creations, so clients can see how I can get them the
solutions they need.

## Dynamic and Responsive Portfolio Expectations

To showcase my wide array of skills and creativity while still being mobile first

- Grid out and flex a layout that is responsive to varying screen sizes.
- Make the use of media queries unnecessary.
- Use Semantic html to create an easty to navigate page for screen reader users and to optimize SEO.

## Features Employed on Responsive Portfolio

- Utilized high contrast for viewability.
- Information from www.w3schools.com was used to create a form with drop down options.
- A clickable button the initiates an email to hamilton.kristina@gmail.com was created with guidance from
  www.w3schools.com
- Font Awesome icons were used on the footer to help distinguish the separate links.
